# Udacity Build a Sudoku Solver
First Project from the Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree

## Synopsis

In this project, students will extend the Sudoku-solving agent developed in the classroom lectures to solve _diagonal_ Sudoku puzzles. A diagonal Sudoku puzzle is identical to traditional Sudoku puzzles with the added constraint that the boxes on the two main diagonals of the board must also contain the digits 1-9 in each cell (just like the rows, columns, and 3x3 blocks).

## Instructions

Follow the instructions in the classroom lesson to install and configure the AIND [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) environment. That environment includes several important packages that are used for the project.
